    1. Go over the all history of the iterations between you and your team members.
    2. Read the feedback and changes carefully.
    3. Decide which changes to accept and which to reject. You don't have to accept all proposed changes. Accept just the ones you think are contributing to a better end result.
    4. Produce a new version of the copy with the changes you decided to accept as well as a short explanation of why you accepted or rejected the proposed changes.
    5. Decide if the new copy is ready to be submitted or if you need to iterate the process to get more feedback from your team members.
    6. Return the new copy as well as your decision if you want to iterate the process or not.

    A a reminder, the initial task was: ${task}

    Here is all the work that has been done so far, including the latest feedback from your team members: ${messageHistory}
